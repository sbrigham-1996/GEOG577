<h1>Project Plan on Deforestation</h1>

<div class="section">
  <h2>1. Objective/Question/Hypothesis</h2>
  <p><strong>How has deforestation in the Amazon Rainforest impacted the regional and global climate system?</strong></p>
  <p>The increasing rate of deforestation occurring in the Amazon Rainforest has a direct impact on the regional level by increasing temperature, reducing evapotranspiration, and decreasing precipitation up to 100 km from deforested areas (Staal et al., 2024). This disruption of the forest-atmosphere connection has further implications on a global scale due to the Amazon's role as a carbon sink. As deforestation increases, the Amazon may transition from a carbon sink to a carbon source, releasing CO<sub>2</sub> instead of absorbing it. This could further exacerbate global climate change. This project aims to analyze the regional climate impacts of deforestation in Pará and explore potential global implications using land cover change and carbon flux data.</p>

<div class="section">
  <h2>2. Area of Interest and Time Frame</h2>
  <p><strong>Country:</strong> Brazil<br>
  <strong>State:</strong> Pará</p>
  <p>Pará is situated in the "arc of deforestation," one of the most heavily deforested areas globally. The pattern often begins with logging, followed by agricultural use, cattle ranching, and infrastructure expansion. I will use LULC maps to assess broad patterns and then narrow to training areas for local-scale analysis. This will be combined with climate data to assess impacts on the regional and global climate systems.</p>
  <p><strong>Time-frame:</strong> 2000 to 2025<br>
  This 25-year span captures deforestation booms (2000–2005), policy-driven declines (2005–2012), and a resurgence of deforestation (2012–2025). This timeline will highlight key shifts in land cover and climate patterns.</p>

<div class="section">
  <h2>3. Data and Resolutions</h2>
  <p><strong>Spatial Resolution:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Landsat 5 & 8 (30m) for historical deforestation trends.</li>
    <li>MODIS Terra/Aqua (250–500m) for regional trends and climate data (e.g., LST, GPP).</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Temporal Resolution:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Landsat (16-day revisit), MODIS (daily).</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Spectral Resolution:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Visible, NIR, SWIR bands for NDVI and land cover indices (Tasseled Cap with Landsat 5).</li>
    <li>Visible, NIR, SWIR, and TIR bands for NDVI, fire detection/scarring, and climate trends.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h2>4. Ancillary Data</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Base Maps:</strong> High-res maps from MapBiomas for land cover validation.</li>
    <li><strong>Climate Data:</strong> ERA5 for temperature, precipitation, and evapotranspiration.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h2>5. Data Availability</h2>
  <p>Multi-temporal datasets from Landsat 5 & 8 and MODIS ensure consistent access to monitor land cover changes and regional climate impacts. ERA5 will complement with climate data at a broader scale.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h2>6. Evaluation of Data Match and Adjustments</h2>
  <p>The spatial and temporal resolutions are well-aligned with my objectives. Ancillary datasets will provide additional validation to ensure a robust analysis of deforestation and climate effects.</p>

<div class="section">
  <h2>8. Comments and Concerns</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Should I adjust the temporal segmentation to better capture seasonal variation in deforestation and climate responses?</li>
    <li>How many training areas should I target after applying the Tasseled Cap approach and initial LULC mapping?</li>
  </ul>
