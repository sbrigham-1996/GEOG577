  <title>Deforestation in the Amazon</title>

<h1>Project Plan on Deforestation</h1>
<h2>1. Objective/Question/Hypothesis</h2>
<p><strong> How has deforestation in the Amazon Rainforest impacted the regional and global climate system?</strong></p>
  <p><strong> The increasing rate of deforestation occuring in the Amazon Rainforest has a direct impact on the regional level
    by increases of temperature, reduction of evapotranspiration, and decreases in precipitation upwards of 100km from deforested areas
     (Staal et al., 2024). This disruption of the forest and atmospheric connection can have further implications on a global
    scale due to the sheer scale of deforestation and importance of the Amazon Rainforest's role globally by acting as a carbon sink. As deforestation
    continues to increase, the Amazon Rainforest may transition from a carbon sink to a carbon source, releasing large amounts of carbon dioxide into
    the atmosphere oppoosed to absorbing it and releasing oxygen. This can have a significant impact on the global climate system and further contribute to 
    the positive feedback loop of the warming climate. The objective of this project is to analyze the impact of deforestation in the Amazon Rainforest on the regional level,
    and to further investigate the potential implications of deforestation in the Amazon Rainforest on the global climate system. By analyzing the changes in land use and land cover over time, I hope
    observe the impact of deforestation on the regional climate system, and by analyzing the carbon flux data, we can observe the potential implications of deforestation on the global climate system. The results of this project
    to provide insight into the impact of deforestation in the Amazon Rainforest on the regional scale and how it may provide an effect on the climate system.</strong></p>
<h2>2. Description of Area of Interest and Time Frame</h2>

<p<><strong>Brazil</strong></p>
<p><strong>State : Pará</strong></p>
<p><strong>The state is situated in the arc of deforestation represent one of the heaviest deforested
  areas globally. Primary Land Use changes are driven particularly by agriculture, cattle ranching and major road constructions that
  have exploded in rates in more recent years. By analyzing the overall state of Pará initially, I can observe the impact of deforestation on the more broad
  scale before narrowing it down to select training areas within the state. Once identifying the training areas, I can further analyze the impact of deforestation
  on the regional climate system and how it may have implications on the global climate system. 
</strong></p>

<p><strong>Time-frame: 2000 to 2025 ; 
  By keeping a temporal component that spans over 25 years, we can observe the changes in deforestation rates and climate paterns clearly. Due to
heavy deforestation years in the Amazon Rainforest from 2000 - 2005 , I plan to capture a strong baseline by mapping the NDVI change during that era.
Followed by reduction of deforestation due to policy change from 2005 - 2012, I hope to capture rebounding effects of carbon flux and correlating land surface temperature changes
before seeing further deforestation at a rapid pace from 2012 - 2025. By using this time - frame precisely, I believe I will capture a strong variance between the separate time periods
and show how deforestation can have affects on the climate system.> </strong></p>

<h2>3. Description of Data and Resolutions</h2>
<p><strong>Spatial Resolution:
•	Landsat 7 and 8 for historical LULC detection.
•	Sentinel & Sentinel-2 for more recent high-resolution monitoring and NDVI Changes.
•	MODIS (250–500m) for regional-scale trends.

•	Temporal Resolution:
•	Landsat (16-day revisit), Sentinel-2 (5-day), MODIS (daily) to detect seasonal and interannual variation.
•	Spectral Resolution:
•	Use of visible, NIR, SWIR bands to generate NDVI and land cover indices with help of machine learning algorithms such as 
Random Forest.</strong></p>

<h2>Data Type:</h2>
<p><strong>Primarily optical remote sensing (Landsat, Sentinel-2, MODIS), complemented with climate reanalysis (ERA5) and carbon flux datasets (FLUXNET).</p></strong>
<h3>Data Characteristics</h3>
<h2>4. Ancillary Data</h2>
<strong>Base Maps:</strong> High-resolution base maps from sources such as MapBiomas to help confirm land cover classes.<br>
<strong>Climate Data: Era5 data for insight on temperature, precipitation, and evapotranspiration change </strong>
<strong>Carbon Flux Data: FLUXNET data for insight on carbon flux changes over time</strong>
<h2>5. Data Availability</h2>
<strong> Data availability for sensors such as Landsat, Sentinel, and Modis will provide consistent access
  of multi-temporal data to analyze the changes in land use and land cover over time. The availability of climate data from ERA5 will provide insight
   on the changes in temperature, precipitation, and evapotranspiration. The availability of carbon flux data seems likely to find through
    FLUXNET, which will provide insight on the carbon flux changes over time. In conjunction, All these data sources and availabilities will provide a 
    comprehensive look into deforestation trends over time in Brazil and how it may impact the regional and global climate system.</strong>
<h2>6. Evaluation of Data Match and Potential Adjustments</h2>
<strong>The spatial and temporal resolutions in section 3 align well with ancillary data that will be gathered, and combined
  I believe will give a thorough analysis into the deforestation in the state of Pará and will allow visually to see if there are impacts on 
the regional climate system.</strong>

<h2>8. Comments and Concerns</h2>
<strong>Is there a need to adjust the temporal segmentation to account for seasonal variations in deforestation and climate responses?</strong>
<strong>How many training areas should I consider after discovering more locally scaled deforestation a LULC change map of the state.</strong>
