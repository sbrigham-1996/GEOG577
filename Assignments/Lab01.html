//1. Interpret your results. Specifically:
// The end results show a majority gain of vegetation in our 'roi'.
// The Pacific Palisades and Eaton fires have a strong trend of vegetation growth from June
// to Dec, and this growth of chapparal is indicative of the devastating wildfires in SoCal.

//

//a) What do the different values of your difference image represent? 
//  The colored pixels of yellow and red are densely vegetated areas in the mountainous regions
//  One can spot the urban areas as the color white because they don't reflect radiation 
//  acquired by the NDVI//

//b) Is there a better way (compared to difference in NDVI) to assess fuel conditions from remote sensing data?
  //  With a little research it's clear that while NDVI is a strong tool, there are other 
  // indices we can use in conjunction, such as NDMI, which is the Normalized Dif. Moisture Indice//

//c) Are these two dates the best dates to use for this analysis? 
//  These two dates likely aren't the best because we had pulled randomly from the parameters
// we set with Sentinel and if one wanted to do more research to find better dates, they could.
// however, assessing NDVI differences in present time, would likely show drastic pixel-color
// change in the roi due to burns devastating land.//

//d) What notable patterns do you observe in your difference image, and how might they be explained?
// The most notable patterns are the vegetation buildup in the highly elevated areas.
// also, the pacific palisades was covered in vegetation which points out to why the fires
// were so devastating in that region//

//e) Summarize the difference in spatial resolution between the SRTM data and the Sentinel Data. 
// The difference in spatial resolution between the SRTM data and the Sentinel Data is
// the srtm dataset is a vector file, which depicts contour lines that show how massive these
// mountains are in relation to the coast. The Sentinel Data is raster data, and acquires 
// different spectral measurements to accurately depict the landscape in true color. //
